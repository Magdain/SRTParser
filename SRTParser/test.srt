1
00:00:00,673 --> 00:00:02,568
(soft scratching)

2
00:00:02,568 --> 00:00:05,384
(ascending bells ringing)

3
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:12,207
(energetic music)

4
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,912
Voiceover: Did you know the idea that people with

5
00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:19,795
autism don't like affection is actually a myth?

6
00:00:20,273 --> 00:00:23,366
Did you know autism doesn't just affect children?
(kissing)

7
00:00:23,582 --> 00:00:26,203
Children with autism grow up to be adults with autism
Man: Oh no!

8
00:00:26,203 --> 00:00:27,956
Voiceover: but compared to children

9
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:30,113
we know relatively little about the numbers of

10
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,284
adults and their needs in adulthood.

11
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:35,462
Did you know boys are four times more likely

12
00:00:35,462 --> 00:00:37,851
to develop autism than girls?

13
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:39,556
Estimates vary between

14
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:41,956
four to one and fifteen to one.

15
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:45,421
Did you know 40% of all children with

16
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:48,123
autism have to wait more than three years

17
00:00:48,123 --> 00:00:51,047
for a clear diagnosis from their doctor?

18
00:00:51,648 --> 00:00:53,352
Did you know people with autism often want to

19
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:56,275
Short Boy: Hey kid, what's your name?
Voiceover: make friends but due to their disability

20
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:58,952
find it very difficult?

21
00:00:58,952 --> 00:01:00,443
Boy: He's weird

22
00:01:00,443 --> 00:01:02,583
Sitting Boy: Yeah, totally. Let's go.

23
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,124
Voiceover: Did you know less than 15 percent of

24
00:01:05,124 --> 00:01:08,349
adults with autism are in full-time paid employment,

25
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:10,144
even though they may have the adequate

26
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,081
cognitive and communicative ability to perform

27
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:16,309
functional and meaningful tasks and jobs?

28
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,370
The buzz about autism is everywhere these days.

29
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,521
The numbers released by the CDC are

30
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:24,308
increasing at alarming rates.

31
00:01:24,308 --> 00:01:26,194
It is now more common than diabetes,

32
00:01:26,194 --> 00:01:28,446
cancer, or down syndrome.

33
00:01:28,446 --> 00:01:30,249
With numbers this high it is apparent

34
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:33,161
that autism touches everyone in some way.

35
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,934
Based on statistics from the

36
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:36,795
US Department of Education

37
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:38,304
and other government agencies,

38
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,793
autism is growing at a startling rate

39
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:43,286
of 10 to 17 percent per year.

40
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:46,134
At this rate the autism society estimates

41
00:01:46,134 --> 00:01:48,074
that the prevalence of autism could reach

42
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:51,327
four million Americans in the next decade.

43
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:53,987
Autism knows no racial, ethnic,

44
00:01:53,987 --> 00:01:56,085
or social boundaries, family income levels,

45
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:58,682
lifestyle choices, or educational levels,

46
00:01:58,682 --> 00:02:02,216
and can affect any family and any child.

47
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:07,312
(child crying)
Some families experience autism first hand.

48
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,528
Others experience it second hand,

49
00:02:10,528 --> 00:02:13,822
such as within their communities or social circles.

50
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:16,721
After we examine all impacts of ASD

51
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:19,901
including social, economical and educational

52
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:22,360
it is obvious that we are all affected directly

53
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,783
or indirectly by this disorder.

54
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,118
^Although there are similarities in people

55
00:02:27,118 --> 00:02:30,018
^with ASD, the spectrum is diverse.

56
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:31,972
^The individuals are so unique

57
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:34,003
no two are exactly alike.

58
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:36,793
^What exactly is autism?

59
00:02:37,255 --> 00:02:38,994
We're going to take a look at this question

60
00:02:38,994 --> 00:02:41,211
but go further and consider the lives

61
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:42,673
of those affected by autism,

62
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:44,825
learn about the diversity existing within the

63
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:48,149
diagnosis and explore the different faces of autism.
